          <p>The was a 44-year long period of geopolitical tension between The Soviet Union and the United States starting in 1947 and ending in 1989. This rivalry would provide plenty of fuel for the upcoming race to the new frontier: space. </p>

Sputnik 2 was not only the second spacecraft launched into Orbit but the first to ever carry a living animal. Laika the Soviet space dog survived several orbits in space before dying a few hours after launch. The U.S wont reach this achievement until January 31st, 1961 when they launch a chimpanzee in space.<p>

            <p>At the end of the 1950s the USSR launched several unmanned probes into orbit. After four failed attempts The Soviets successfully launched Luna 1, but end up missing the moon. Trying to redeem that failure they successfully created and launched Luna 2 which impacted the moon on September 14th, 1959. Riding this success The Soviets launched Luna 3 which took pictures of the far side of the moon on October 6th, 1959.<p>

            <p>On April 12, 1961, the USSR surprised the world again by launching Yuri Gagarin into a single orbit around the Earth in a craft they called Vostok 1. They dubbed Gagarin the first cosmonaut, roughly translated from Russian and Greek as "sailor of the universe".<p>

            <p>On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American in space, launching in a ballistic trajectory on Mercury-Redstone 3, in a spacecraft he named Freedom 7. Though he did not achieve orbit like Gagarin, he was the first person to exercise manual control over his spacecraft's attitude and retro-rocket firing. After his successful return, Shepard was celebrated as a national hero.<p>

            <h3>The Vostoks</h3>
            <p>Cosmonaut Andriyan Nikolayev orbited the Earth 64 times over nearly four days in space, August 11–15, 1962, a feat which would not be matched by NASA until the Gemini program (1965–1966).

            Vostok 3 and Vostok 4 were launched a day apart on trajectories that brought the spacecraft within approximately 4.0 mi of one another. The cosmonauts aboard the two capsules also communicated with each other via radio, the first ship-to-ship communications in space. These missions marked the first time that more than one crewed spacecraft was in orbit at the same time.

            Vostok 6, launched on June 16th, 1963 was the first human spaceflight to carry a woman, cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, into space.<p>

            <h3>More wins for the USSR</h3>
            <p>In Voskhod 1 October 1964 it achieved a number of "firsts" in the history of crewed spaceflight, being the first space flight to carry more than one crewman into orbit, the first flight without the use of spacesuits, and the first to carry either an engineer or a physician into outer space. It also set a crewed spacecraft altitude record of 209 mi.

              Voskhod 2 established another milestone in space exploration when Alexei Leonov became the first person to leave the spacecraft in a specialized spacesuit to conduct a 12-minute "spacewalk". Again, this wouldn't be achieved by America till June 3rd, 1965.  <p>
